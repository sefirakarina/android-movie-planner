# android-movie-planner

**Made with:** Java, Google distance & maps API

This android program makes it possible for the user to create events to watch movies, choose the movie along with the attendees (from phone contacts). The events can be seen through recycle view, custom calendar, and maps. This app also sends notification to today’s event that is close with the user’s current location. The architecture of this program implements MVC design pattern and also uses view model.
